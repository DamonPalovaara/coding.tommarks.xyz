    <h2>2021</h2>
    <h3>Nim Lisp Interpreter</h3>
    <p>
        To continue developing my knowledge of Lisp and to learn a new programming language Nim, I implemented a very simple Lisp interpreter.
        The macro compile-time code generation capabilities of Nim are very interesting for writing code which plays well with Lisp, such as 
        automatically generating code which binds runtime Lisp function arguments (in the form of a Cons-list) to variable names,
        possibly even with auto-generated type checking.

    <h3>7 Day RogueLike 2021</h3>
    <p>
        I attempted to make a small roguelike platformer in 7 days. Overall I didn't succeed in making a roguelike, but I did make a functional
        game with random levels and have continued to make small improvements since the original 7 day deadline.

    <h2>2020</h2>
    <h3>Lisp Interpreter</h3>
    <p>I wrote a simple Lisp interpreter in C based on McCarthy's 1959 paper. It has the minimal set of functions to be an interpreter and a simple
        interface for binding C functions to be called from Lisp. It has no garbage collection so is quite limited in what it can run.

    <h3>Playstation 2 Graphics Synthesizer Buffer/DMA Utilities</h3>
    <p>
        I've been interested in Playstation 2 hardware since 2019 and have a few small experiments resembling games. One headache has been managing
        the state of buffers which are sent to the Graphics Synthesizer (rasterizer). I wrote some utilities for a managed buffer which automatically
        builds DMA headers and Graphics Synthesizer "packets". This is currently embedded in a rendering example <a href="https://github.com/phy1um/ps2draw-examples/tree/basic">here</a>, but it will be polished
        and extracted to a self-contained library in the future.

    <h2>2019</h2>
    <h2>Quake 3 Server Browser API and Discord Bot</h3>
    <p>
        In Quake 3 sending queries to get server status is done over UDP. I wanted to make this easier, so I wrote
        and hosted a web service which periodically queried all public Quake 3 servers and exposed their status (player counts, game settings, admin contact details and more)
        in a REST API. I then built a Discord bot which allowed members of my Discord server to use a !command to prompt the bot to report player activity in local servers.

    <h2>2018</h2>
    <h3>Survey and Data Collection Platform</h3>
    <p>
        I voulenteered to build a survey for an honors student conducting research at the University of Adelaide. The survey contained interractive sections which
        were outside of what is possible with survey builders and existing survey web frameworks/libraries. My solution was built in HTML and Javascript,
        with some data pre-processing for survey question/activity data in Python. I also built the data collection backend, which was a simple NodeJS app 
        storing data in MongoDB.

    <h2>2016</h1>
    <h3>C Game Experiments</h3>
    <p>
        To learn more about lower level programming I dove into C and built simple games using the SDL2 library.

    <h3>Music Playlist Generator</h3>
    <p>
        My first paid programming project was for my local doctor's clinic, building a system to randomly generate Windows Media Player playlists
        from a large collection of music. This was my first project where I had to gather requirements myself. I had to work under tight restrictions 
        and understand data structures to effectively track which songs had been considered already while selecting a variety of genres and artists, based
        on song metadata as well as a song's filesystem path. The system worked well and was in use years later when I visited the same clinic.

    <h2>2014</h2>
    <h3>Card Layout System</h3>
    <p>
        A very modular system which took a list of card data and arranged them into A4 pdfs for printing. Used for generating sheets of Magic: The Gathering
        proxies, but I had ambitions of prototyping my own card game with it that never came together. This was a strange mishmash of Python and Batch scripts.
        I learned a lot from this project by finding ways to glue together existing solutions with my own small scripts to make a larger system.

    <h2>2013</h2>
    <h3>Java Games</h3>
    <p>
        Simple Java games mostly from a top-down perspective. My first Java game "Text Game" was console based, but later ported to a graphical game. I built some simple
        platformers, but never finished anything other than example levels. I spent a lot of time thinking about structuring my code into "engine" and "game"
        sections, which enabled me to share a lot of code between projects.

    <h2>2006-2009</h2>
    <h3>GameMaker Games</h3>
    <p>I started programming with GameMaker, first with the drag-and-drop interface but eventually writing code in "GML", a Java-like language.
        These games impressed my school friends, but are very primitive.
